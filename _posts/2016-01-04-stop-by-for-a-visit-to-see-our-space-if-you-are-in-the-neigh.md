In this tenant improvement, In\*Situ served as it's own client to create a new collaborative work environement for our practice. Our office is located on the 4th floor of the historic Centre Building in downtown El Paso. The historic 1912 structure was designed by architect Henry Trost who along with his engineer borothers were early pioneers in the use of reinforced concrete.
The design intent for the office is to honor the inherit beauty of this historic concrete structure by exposing it where possible. The concrete columns were stripped to the original concrete and the structure exposed to the deck in the central structural bay of the office. Daylight and views were maximized by opening this central core of the office to the exterior on the south and to the building atrium on the north.
