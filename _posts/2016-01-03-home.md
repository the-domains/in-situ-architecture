**In\*Situ**

\[in seye -tooh, in sit -ooh\] 
1730-40; Latin; literally, in place.  1\. In the natural, original, or appropriate position.  2\. Situated in the existing place or position.

In\*Situ Architecture provides full architectural services focusing on contemporary design excellence for the Chihuahuan Desert Region. Our approach to design --- is not base on a pre-determined aesthetic or rigid "Signature style." It is an approach that grows naturally from a quest for ideas and answers. Designs are never imposed, but evolve from a rigorous inquiry into the particulars of site and program. Every new building, every adaptive reuse, every site must address and acknowlege a pre-existing context. At the same time, however, every structure and every intervention --- whether radical ore reverential - ultimately affects that context. At In\*Situ we are sensative to the nuances of place and precedent. We are deeply responsive to content, material culture, and to the historical and physical environment of our region. Yet we believe that imitation subverts creativity - that replication does not produce art.
